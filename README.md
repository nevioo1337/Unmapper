# Unmapper
Unmapper is a powerful tool that allows you to easily dump mapped PE files by hooking WinAPI functions. This versatile tool is perfect for those looking to crack or analyze cheats.

## Usage
Inject the DLL before the mapping process begins. I will attach an image below that shows the optimal settings for the [Xenos](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos) injector.

## Project future
In the future, I plan to add a variety of features such as IPC and RPM hooks, a driver unmapper, a PE file type detector, and an auto binary assembler. My ultimate goal is to develop a fully-featured, easy-to-use dumper that can retrieve all the information you'll ever need.
